# TCP-Chunk-Socket
--- Server and Client Socket Scripts for transmitting large Files ---

Normally, Python Sockets can only send and receive a limited amount of Data. When trying to send large files via a Python Socket, you might run into Errors.

A possible solution to this Problem is to split the Data into Chunks and send them successively.
The Implementation is very simple and not intended for Production Use. The Code has instead been created for educational Purpose.
